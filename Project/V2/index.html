      <h2>Project V2</h2>
      <p>Overall, I had a good time messing around with different styling techniques for this portion of the project. I decided to make my new page a showcase of sorts, to put some of my own personal photos and to also help get a better grasp on grid style layouts with CSS. I opted to continue using my card style layout after having trouble trying to redo everything via flexbox or grids. I really how easy it is to make your site more responsive using these techniques, so I would like to try and learn more and implement for the next version of the project.</p>
      <p>After reviewing the feedback from Version 1, I also decided to do away with the about info being another column on the side. I like the one column, infinite scroll, style layout better. I feel like it doesn't try to unnecessarily pull your attention in one way or the other, so I appreciated that feedback!</p>

      <h5><em>Seattle skyline as seen from the Bremerton ferry.</em></h5>

       <p>This is just an example of how I would want a static block to look.</p>
       <p>Overtime I would like to build this website up to be a hub for the things that interest me. I would like a way to catalogue and view my thoughts in a format that is visually pleasing to me</p>
       <p>My main goal for the V1 portion of this project was getting my framework setup and layout to my liking. I want this site to be responsive and this is one of my top priorities so I appoligize for how bland it looks at the moment! If you collapse your browser to be under 1060px wide you can see it format to mobile view and below 400px the links (when i add more) will stack on top of eachother! Try loading the site on your phone to see how it looks. </p>
