       <p>This is just an example of how I would want a static block to look.</p>
      
       <p>Overtime I would like to build this website up to be a hub for the things that interest me. I would like a way to catalogue and view my thoughts in a format that is visually pleasing to me</p>
      
       <p>My main goal for the V1 portion of this project was getting my framework setup and layout to my liking. I want this site to be responsive and this is one of my top priorities so I appoligize for how bland it looks at the moment! If you collapse your browser to be under 955px wide you can see it format to mobile view and below 400px the links (when i add more) will stack on top of eachother! Try loading the site on your phone to see how it looks. </p>
