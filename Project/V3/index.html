      <article>
      <h3>What Changed?</h3>
      <i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i>
      <p> For version 3 of the site I decided to re-do my top navigation bar as a flex item. I added a media rule that collapses the links at 768px and adds a hamburger style drop-down menu for easier navigation on mobile. I stickied the nav bar to the top as well so the site is easier to navigate overall on all devices.</p>
      <p>After reviewing feedback from last verison's discussion, I decided to clean-up my homepage a bit more and make things more uniform. Going forward I will begin to structure my 'about this verison' posts like this one.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>What was added?</h3>
      <i class="far fa-plus-square"></i>
     <p>I added a new page titled 'Data'. On this new page I added a simple table with responsive properties to allow the data to be easily viewed. I documented all my style properties on my stlye sheet under the 'Style the table' note I added.</p>
     <p>Other than the addition mentioned above, I only added some small things. I included some font awesome icons throughout and I was able to get a site logo up and working and yes it is a coffee emoji ‚òï.</p>

      <h2>Project V2</h2>
      <p>Overall, I had a good time messing around with different styling techniques for this portion of the project. I decided to make my new page a showcase of sorts, to put some of my own personal photos and to also help get a better grasp on grid style layouts with CSS.
      </p>
      <p>I opted to continue using my card style layout after having trouble trying to redo everything via flexbox or grids. I really how easy it is to make your site more responsive using these techniques, so I would like to try and learn more and implement for the next version of the project.
      </p>
      <p>After reviewing the feedback from Version 1, I also decided to do away with the about info being another column on the side. I like the one column, infinite scroll, style layout better. I feel like it doesn't try to unnecessarily pull your attention in one way or the other, so I appreciated that feedback!

      <h2>Project V1</h2>
       <p>My main goal for the V1 portion of this project was getting my framework setup and layout to my liking. I want this site to be responsive and this is one of my top priorities so I appoligize for how bland it looks at the moment!</p>
       <p>If you collapse your browser to be under 1060px wide you can see it format to mobile view and below 400px the links (when i add more) will stack on top of eachother! Try loading the site on your phone to see how it looks. </p>
